# Open Design topics:
### MQTT
* Message content currently supports Particle requirements: What about Arduino and others?
* Message format currently JSON: What about CSV, and/or others?
* Topic name is currently 'time/zone' 
* If multiple formats, perhaps something like timezone/JSON
* If content for multiple IOT devices is different, perhaps timezone/Arduino/JSON


* This prototype generates flat JSON (No nesting or arrays). This makes it easy to parse without a library.
